HxFXr
=====

Haxe3 port of Thomas Vian's as3sfxr (https://code.google.com/p/as3sfxr/), itself a port of Tomas Petterson's SFXR (http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)

This port is intended to simplify SFXR use in Haxe projects targeting Flash, though it does not include the GUI elements of the AS3 version.
In the future, this port can hopefully be rethought to rely entirely on the Haxe APIs, making its wave generation fully cross platform.
